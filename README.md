In this project, I analyze crime data in Los Angeles to uncover trends and patterns that can assist the LAPD in optimizing resource allocation. Using the crimes.csv dataset, I explore crime frequencies by hour, identify high-crime areas during the night, and categorize crimes based on victim age groups. This analysis provides insights that can help improve public safety in one of the largest cities in the world.
